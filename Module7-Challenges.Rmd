**Challenge 1**
Given a vector, write a function to determine the geometric mean of the values in a vector.
```{r}
#reminder: to create a function: function name <- function(arguments/inputs){code to run}
geometricMean <- function(x){
  prod(x)^(1/length(x))
  #takes the product of all of the values in the vector x, raises it to the 1/n, which is the same as taking the nth root of it.
}

vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 1000)
#creates a vector: a series of data of the same data type
geometricMean(vector)
#runs our function that we just created on the vector we just created

#Note: na.rm = TRUE, and na.omit() can be helpful tools
```
