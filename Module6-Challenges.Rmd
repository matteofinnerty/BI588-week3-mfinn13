**Challenge 1**
Loading a data set into a data frame, and summarizing the variables in that data frame using the summary() function. 
```{r}
library(curl)
file <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/refs/heads/master/AN588_Fall23/Country-Data-2016.csv")
#loading data set by using a github url that links to the raw data
dataframe <- read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#creates a new data frame using the data that was loaded into file. Header = true indicates that there is a header in the data set.
#sep indicates what is used to separate data. Strings as factors converts all the strings to factors. Reminder: factors are 
#strings that have numeric values assigned to them. 
head(dataframe)
#first 6 rows of data
summary(dataframe)
#summary of the different variables
```
